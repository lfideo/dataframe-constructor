# dataframe-constructor
The script automatically locates files in particular directory, say, in ~/Downloads. Then it moves files to the directory of interest, say, 
where your project is stored. After that, it iterates over existing files and concatenates them together into a dataframe.
This is useful when you download files to your computer from some source, like Telegram, in this case. 

As a result, you don't have to manually move files to different folders or directories and concatenate different dataframes together, 
which saves you plenty of time.
